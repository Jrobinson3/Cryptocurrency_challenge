# Cryptocurrency_challenge

This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:
Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

The purpose of this analysis is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

All Deliverables 1 through 4 are coding, see https://github.com/Jrobinson3/Cryptocurrency_challenge/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb

In deliverable 4, create a table with tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function, and this result printed on the seperate window.  See below image:

Additionally, the 3D scatter plot was not printed in the crypto_clustering.ipynb.  See below image:
